  <h1>Panoramic Room vs Ocean View Room</h1>

  <p>These two hotel room categories sound similar but describe different things.</p>

  <h2>Panoramic room</h2>
  <p>A panoramic room focuses on a wide, immersive view regardless of landscape — city, mountains, or ocean.</p>

  <h2>Ocean view room</h2>
  <p>An ocean view room simply means the ocean is visible. The view might be partial, distant, or only visible from one angle.</p>

  <h2>Which is better?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose panoramic for the “wow factor” and natural light.</li>
    <li>Choose ocean view if water visibility is your priority.</li>
  </ul>
