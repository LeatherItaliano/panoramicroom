      <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The 4 hotel room views most people actually want</h2>
      <p>Hotels use dozens of labels (“premium view”, “signature view”, “scenic view”), but most bookings fall into four buckets. Here’s what they usually mean in practice — and what to check before you pay extra.</p>

      <div class="img-grid" aria-label="Examples of popular hotel room views">
        <figure>
          <img
            class="img"
            src="/Oceanview-Room.jpg"
            alt="Ocean view hotel room with beach and water visible from the room"
            loading="lazy"
            decoding="async"
          />
          <figcaption><strong>Ocean view:</strong> Look for “full” vs “partial” vs “side” — these words change the experience.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            class="img"
            src="/wynn-resort-corner-pano-city-view.jpg"
            alt="Corner panoramic hotel room with dual-window city skyline view"
            loading="lazy"
            decoding="async"
          />
          <figcaption><strong>Panoramic / corner room:</strong> Corner placement can create the widest angles with two walls of glass.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <h3>Ocean view</h3>
      <p>Ocean views are the classic “worth it” upgrade — especially for sunrise, sunset, and that feeling of space. The catch: many “ocean view” rooms are angled, distant, or only visible from the balcony.</p>

      <h3>City skyline view</h3>
      <p>City views are the nighttime winners. If you care about the vibe, skyline lights beat most daytime scenery. But “city view” can also mean “faces the street”, so it’s worth checking noise and privacy.</p>

      <h3>Mountain / nature view</h3>
      <p>Nature views tend to be quieter and more relaxing — best in daylight. They can also be the most inconsistent because trees, rooflines, and neighbouring buildings block sightlines in ways hotel photos don’t show.</p>

      <h3>Panoramic room</h3>
      <p>A panoramic room is usually a wide-angle view experience — not a bigger room. Panoramic often comes from corner layouts, higher floors, better window placement, or floor-to-ceiling glass.</p>

    <section id="choose">
      <h2>How to choose the best hotel room view for <em>your</em> trip</h2>
      <p>Here’s the simplest way to choose: start with how you’ll spend time in the room. The best view is the one you’ll actually enjoy — not the one that looks best in marketing photos.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Fast decision rule:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Morning person?</strong> Prioritise sunrise-facing ocean or mountains/nature.</li>
          <li><strong>Out all day?</strong> Don’t overpay — pick a mid-tier view and put the money into location or breakfast.</li>
          <li><strong>Evenings in the room?</strong> City skyline wins (lights + atmosphere).</li>
          <li><strong>Special occasion?</strong> Panoramic / corner rooms tend to deliver the biggest “wow”.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Higher floors usually win (but only if the direction is right)</h3>
      <p>Higher floors reduce obstructions and make views feel wider. That’s why “panoramic” is sometimes shorthand for “high floor”. But height alone isn’t enough — a high floor facing the wrong direction is still a miss.</p>

      <h3>Corner rooms are the closest thing to a cheat code</h3>
      <p>Corner rooms often create a true panoramic angle — two window walls, more glass, and a layout that naturally frames the view. If you’re choosing between “standard view” and “corner panoramic”, the corner category usually wins for experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="terms">
      <h2>Hotel view terms that cause the most disappointment</h2>
      <p>These labels sound harmless, but they’re where most “this isn’t what I expected” reviews come from.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Partial view:</strong> You may only see the ocean/skyline at an angle, or from a specific spot (sometimes balcony only).</li>
        <li><strong>Side view / angled view:</strong> The feature exists, but you’re not facing it directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited view:</strong> Something cuts into the scene — trees, rooftops, nearby buildings.</li>
        <li><strong>Obstructed view:</strong> There is a real blockage (construction, tower, signage). It might still be “a view”, but not the one you paid for.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenic view / premium view:</strong> Vague marketing terms. Treat these as “needs verification”.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted"><strong>Reality:</strong> marketing photos are often shot from the best corner of the best room, with wide lenses and perfect conditions. That’s why verification matters.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:0;">The best way to verify a hotel room view (before booking)</h2>
      <p>To confirm the true view — angle, height, and obstructions — look for <strong>real guest-submitted photos</strong> of your exact room category. This is the fastest way to avoid paying for a view that only exists in marketing.</p>

    <section id="faq">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <p><strong>What is the best hotel room view?</strong><br>
      The best hotel room view depends on your trip: ocean views are perfect for sunrise/sunset, city skyline views shine at night, mountain/nature views are calming in daylight, and panoramic rooms usually offer the widest angles. Verify the view for your exact room category before paying extra.</p>

      <p><strong>What does “partial view” mean?</strong><br>
      Partial view often means you can see the feature only from an angle, from one side of the room, or only from the balcony. Real guest photos are the most reliable way to confirm the actual angle.</p>

      <p><strong>Are higher floors always better?</strong><br>
      Usually, yes — fewer obstructions and a wider feel. But direction matters more: a high floor facing the wrong way can still be disappointing.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I verify the view before booking?</strong><br>
      Look for real guest-submitted photos/videos of the room category you’re booking. This shows the true angle, height, and any obstructions that marketing photos often hide.</p>
