  <h1>What Is a Panoramic Room?</h1>

  <p>A panoramic room is a hotel room designed to maximise wide, immersive views using larger windows, corner positioning, higher floors, or floor-to-ceiling glass. Unlike standard rooms, the focus is on the breadth and quality of the outlook.</p>

  <h2>Typical features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wide or wraparound windows</li>
    <li>Corner room positioning</li>
    <li>More natural light</li>
    <li>Higher floor locations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why panoramic rooms cost more</h2>
  <p>Hotels usually have only a few rooms with truly wide views, which makes them premium inventory.</p>

  <h2>Is it worth it?</h2>
  <p>If the view is part of the experience — romantic trips, photography, relaxing stays — panoramic rooms can be worth paying extra for.</p>
