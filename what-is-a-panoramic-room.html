  <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Panoramic room definition</h2>
  <p>A panoramic room is a hotel room designed to maximise wide, immersive views. The term “panoramic” refers to the breadth and depth of the outlook — not necessarily the size of the room itself.</p>

  <p>In practice, panoramic rooms are usually created through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Corner positioning for dual-angle visibility</li>
    <li>Floor-to-ceiling or expanded glass panels</li>
    <li>Higher floor placement to reduce obstructions</li>
    <li>Room layouts designed around the view</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Panoramic describes the experience of the view — not the square footage.</p>

  <h2>Why panoramic rooms cost more</h2>
  <p>Hotels typically have limited inventory of rooms with true wide-angle positioning. Because these rooms are scarce and often deliver higher guest satisfaction, they are priced as premium inventory.</p>

  <figure>
    <img
      class="img"
      src="/night-view-from-room.jpg"
      alt="Night panoramic hotel room view with illuminated skyline seen through large windows"
      loading="lazy"
      decoding="async"
    />
    <figcaption>Panoramic rooms often feel most dramatic at night when skyline lights create depth.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The price premium reflects both demand and scarcity.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Is a panoramic room worth it?</h2>

  <p>A panoramic room is often worth paying extra for if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The destination is known for its scenery</li>
    <li>You plan to spend time relaxing in the room</li>
    <li>The view is central to a special occasion</li>
    <li>Photography or ambience matters to you</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It may not be worth it if you’ll be out all day or if the panoramic label only refers to height rather than angle or window design.</p>

    <img
      class="img"
      src="/view-from-our-room-ocean.jpg"
      alt="Wide ocean view from a hotel room balcony overlooking coastline"
      loading="lazy"
      decoding="async"
    />
    <figcaption>Some panoramic rooms face ocean, others city or mountains — the key is verifying the angle and openness.</figcaption>

<section class="card">
  <h2 style="margin-top:0;">How to verify a panoramic room before booking</h2>
  <p>Marketing images often show the best possible angle in ideal conditions. The safest way to confirm what you’re actually getting is to review real guest-submitted images of the exact room category.</p>

  <h2>Common misconceptions about panoramic rooms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Panoramic does not always mean ocean-facing.</li>
    <li>Panoramic does not guarantee larger room size.</li>
    <li>Higher floor does not automatically mean unobstructed view.</li>
    <li>Corner rooms are often panoramic — but not always.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final takeaway</h2>
  <p>A panoramic room is about <strong>view immersion</strong> — width, light, and openness. It can dramatically improve your stay when the scenery matters. The key is confirming what the hotel means by “panoramic” before you pay the premium.</p>
